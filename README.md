# AUTOMATIC SPEECH RECOGNITION (ASR) PROJECTS**
 
## Overview

Welcome to my Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) Portfolio, where I showcase a series of projects focused on advancing voice technology, particularly in African languages. As an AI engineer with a profound passion for machine learning and deep learning, I have immersed myself in mastering the intricacies of ASR frameworks, ensuring each project reflects a dedication to efficiency, fundamental principles, and cutting-edge solutions.

Explore the diverse projects presented here, each designed to demonstrate the application of ASR technology in solving unique challenges related to voice recognition and classification. Whether it's building models for Swahili audio classification or training ASR models for Kiswahili, these projects underscore my commitment to pushing the boundaries of voice technology.
