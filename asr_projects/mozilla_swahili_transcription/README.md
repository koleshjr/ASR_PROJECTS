**Title:**
Mozilla Foundation - Mozilla Common Voice Hackathon I Nairobi

**Overview:**
Welcome to the Mozilla Common Voice Hackathon in Nairobi, a part of the Mozilla Foundation's open-source initiative to make voice technology more inclusive. This hackathon focuses on training an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model for Kiswahili, leveraging the Mozilla Common Voice (MCV) dataset for Kiswahili. Supported by funding from Bill and Melinda Gates, FCDO, and GIZ, this initiative aims to equip the East African technical community with the skills to build voice technology.

**Aim:**
The primary objective of this challenge is to train an ASR model for Kiswahili using the MCV Kiswahili dataset. The focus extends beyond building a well-performing model; the emphasis is on models demonstrating comparable performance across demographic characteristics, particularly age and gender. The challenge evaluates the model's performance on specific demographic groups, including women, men, and age subcategories.

**Importance of the Challenge:**
- **Inclusive Voice Technology:** Enhancing the growth of open-source datasets for African languages, especially Kiswahili, contributes to making voice technology more inclusive and accessible.
- **Problem Solving:** The hackathon is designed to foster a developer community with the skills to leverage the MCV Kiswahili dataset for problem-solving, driving impactful solutions.

**Challenge Details:**
- **ASR Model Training:** Participants will train an ASR model for Kiswahili using the MCV Kiswahili dataset, focusing on achieving high performance.
- **Demographic Comparison:** Evaluation will include comparing the overall performance of the model across different demographic characteristics, such as age and gender.
- **Subcategory Evaluation:** Specific evaluation sets representing women, men, and age subcategories (under 30 and over 30) will provide insights into the model's performance across diverse groups.

**Technologies Used:**
- **ASR Frameworks:** conformer, wav2vec, whisper and other ASR frameworks.
- **Open-Source Tools:** nvidia nemo, huggingface, pytorch, and other open-source tools.
